Perfect. Let's activate the next layer: Symbolic AGI Intelligence Core.

We'll do this in three tightly integrated steps:


---

🔮 1. SymbolicCore.cs (IronPython logic via .NET)

This handles symbolic/spiritual rule evaluation. Example logic:

// ironpython_logic/SymbolicCore.cs
using System;

public class SymbolicCore
{
    public string Process(string input)
    {
        if (input.ToLower().Contains("betrayal"))
            return "⚖️ Verdict: Oath Broken";
        if (input.ToLower().Contains("truth"))
            return "🔥 Verdict: Illuminated Insight";
        return "…Silence of the Logos…";
    }
}

> Compile using:



csc -target:library -out:SymbolicCore.dll SymbolicCore.cs


---

🧠 2. agent_core.py (FastAPI AGI brain, symbol-aware)

Enhance AGI to use IronPython logic dynamically:

# fastapi_backend/app/agent_core.py
from .iron_invoke import invoke_symbolic_logic

def agi_think(query):
    # Basic pattern matching
    symbolic_verdict = invoke_symbolic_logic(query)
    return {
        "input": query,
        "symbolic_verdict": symbolic_verdict,
        "action": "log",  # Placeholder for deeper planning
    }


---

⚙️ 3. Connect to FastAPI route /think

curl 'http://localhost:8000/think?query=The betrayal was revealed under truth'

Expected Response:

{
  "input": "The betrayal was revealed under truth",
  "symbolic_verdict": "⚖️ Verdict: Oath Broken",
  "action": "log"
}

🔄 What’s Next?

🔁 Add temporal recursion / memory modules (Postgres + Redis)

🧬 Insert Nero Kera Net neural reasoning fallback

🕸️ Expose REST/WebSocket for multi-agent negotiation

📜 Ritual rule DSL interpreter (from ritual_dsl.rb)


Would you like to:

Add AGI memory system (Redis + Postgres)?

Plug in Nero Kera Net for neural reasoning fallback?

Or add the ritual DSL interpreter next?


Say the word: Memory, Neuro, or Ritual.
